# ES-DE-custom-systems
This here is the xml files for Emulation Station - Desktop Edition (ES-DE) for my retro gaming handheld, as it lacked the required alternative emulator selections for my switch emulators and other emulators like dolphin for handheld for wii and gamecube emulation. With a few extra parts for other systems that i might need in the future should I decide to change the emulator I am using for better performance. 

Please take note that not all the code here is mine, as I did take parts of it from posts on forums to add to this.
